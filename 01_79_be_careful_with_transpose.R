talldata$month # able to use $ to address column
str(talldata) #int, char and factor

# wide data instead of tall
widedata <- t(talldata)
str(widedata)
# hey - now everything is the same type - in this case, a character
# $ addressing doesn't work
# that's because talldata was coerced to a matrix
class(widedata)

# compare these two
talldata #dataframe
as.matrix(talldata) #matrix

# addressing columns
talldata$alpha # this won't work with widedata
talldata[,2] # this works
widedata[2,] # this works

# note that factors are converted to appropriate levels - but as strings
str(talldata$month)
str(widedata[3,])

# how about converting a matrix to a data.frame?
widedataAsDF <- as.data.frame(widedata, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
widedataAsDF[3,] <- factor(widedataAsDF[3,]) #nope
# dataframes aren't spreadsheets. 
# dataframe columns can have differing types
# dataframe rows are all the same structure

# hint: look at tidyr from the tidyverse
